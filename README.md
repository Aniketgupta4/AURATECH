# 🌍 Data Pathways to Healthy Cities and Human Settlements  

## 📖 Overview  
Urban populations are rising rapidly, which increases pressure on *air quality, green spaces, and public health systems*. Poor air quality and lack of greenery cause serious health issues like asthma, respiratory infections, and cardiovascular diseases.  

This project uses *Earth-observation data* (e.g., NASA/ISRO satellite datasets) to monitor urban environmental factors such as pollution, vegetation cover, and climate. The insights help in *urban planning, sustainable development, and public health improvement*.  

---

## 🚀 Objectives  
- Monitor *air quality, vegetation, and climate* using Earth data.  
- Support *data-driven decision making* for healthier cities.  
- Provide *tools and dashboards* for urban planners and health authorities.  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- *Data Sources:* NASA Earthdata, ISRO Bhuvan, Sentinel, MODIS, OpenAQ  
- *Programming:* Python (Flask / FastAPI), Jupyter Notebooks  
- *Libraries:* Pandas, NumPy, Rasterio, GDAL  
- *Visualization:* Plotly, Dash, Leaflet.js  
- *ML Models:* Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional)  
- *Deployment:* Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/Azure/GCP
